# Replication code of "XXX" (Fukasawa, 2024)

This repository contains replication codes of the paper titled "XXX" by Takeshi Fukasawa, proposing VF-PGI (Value function- Policy Gradient Iteration) algorithm for computationally efficiently solving dynamic models with continuous actions.  It is composed of three folders. The first is "XXX", and it contains replication codes of the paper using MATLAB. The second is XXX

Note that the code relies on my other repository takeshi-fukasawa/spectral. If you run the replication code, please also download the spectral repository, and modify the path specified in the main code.
