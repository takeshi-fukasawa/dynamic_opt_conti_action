% Simulation_ECM.m is a routine for simulating the solution to the
% neoclassical growth model, considered in the article  "Envelope Condition 
% Method with an Application to Default Risk Models" by Cristina Arellano, 
% Lilia Maliar, Serguei Maliar and Viktor Tsyrennikov, Journal of Economic
% Dynamics and Control (2016), 69, 436-459 (henceforth, AMMT, 2016).    
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Inputs:    "A" is the normalizing constant in production;
%            "alpha" is the share of capital in production;
%            "gam" is the utility-function parameter;
%            "delta" is the depreciation rate;
%            "sigma" is the standard deviation of the productivity shock;
%            "rho" is the autocorrelation coefficient in the process for
%               shock;
%            "vf" is the vector of polynomial coefficients in the 
%               approximated value function;  
%            "D" is the degree of polynomial approximation
%
% Output:    "k" is current capital;
%            "z" is current productivity
